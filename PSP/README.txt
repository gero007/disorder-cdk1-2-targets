PhosphoSitePlusÂ® v6.5.9.2

Getting the CDK1 subfamily substrates via the web site generate identical results for CDK1 and CDK2. I wasn't having this results before.

I can approximate the results obtained before using the Kinase_Substrate_Dataset and filtering for humans.   

If I clean both of the datasets and I merge them (see clean versions xlsx), then I can find 1007 unique entries.(PSP_CDK1famTarget_HS_RAW.tab)

I manually separate "PSP_CDK1famTarget_HS_RAW.tab" into the 3 Kinases. This is for getting the 3 files that can be merge by the R pipeline
